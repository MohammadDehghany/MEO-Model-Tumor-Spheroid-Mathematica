# Mathematica code for mechano-electro-osmotic (MEO) spheroid model — Figure 5B

This repository contains a Mathematica notebook used to reproduce results associated with the accompanying manuscript.

## What this code reproduces
The notebook reproduces the results shown in **Figure 5B**, which reports:
- **Cell area** (radial profile)
- **Cell aspect ratio** (radial profile)

For completeness, the notebook also computes and plots the **solid stress field versus radial distance**, although this quantity is not displayed in Figure 5B.

## Contents
- `MEO_spheroid_model_Fig5B.nb`  
  Main Mathematica notebook (parameters, equations, numerical solution, and plotting for Figure 5B and the solid stress field).

## Software requirements
- Wolfram Mathematica 13.1 or later (the notebook was prepared in Mathematica 13.1).

## How to run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `MEO_spheroid_model_Fig5B.nb` in Mathematica.
3. Evaluate the notebook from top to bottom.
4. The notebook displays the generated plots in the notebook interface.
